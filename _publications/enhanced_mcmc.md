collection: publications
permalink: /publication/enhanced_mcmc
excerpt: 'We introduce several discrete Metropolis-Hastings samplers that are conceptually inspired by MALA, and demonstrate their strong empirical performance across a range of challenging sampling problems in Bayesian inference and energy-based modelling. Methodologically, we identify why discrete analogues to \emph{preconditioned} MALA are generally intractable, motivating us to introduce a new kind of preconditioning based on auxiliary variables and the "Gaussian integral trick".'
