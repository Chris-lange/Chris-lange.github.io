title: "Generating Binary Species Range Maps"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/binary
excerpt: "Deep learning-based SDMs generate a continuous probability representing the presence of a species at a given location, which must be binarized by setting per-species thresholds to obtain binary range maps. However, selecting appropriate per-species thresholds to binarize these predictions is non-trivial, since different species can require different thresholds. In this work, we evaluate different approaches for automatically identifying the best thresholds for binarizing range maps using presence-only data. This includes approaches that require the generation of additional pseudo-absence data, along with ones that only require presence data. We also propose an extension of an existing presence-only technique that is more robust to outliers. We perform a detailed evaluation of different thresholding techniques on the tasks of binary range estimation and large-scale fine-grained visual classification, and we demonstrate improved performance over existing approaches using our technique. <br> <br>
