title: "Active Learning-Based Species Range Estimation"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/active
excerpt: "Here we investigate a new active learning based approach for the prediction of a species' range from limited data and evaluate our approach on two ground truth datasets. Our approach makes use of species distribution models for well known species in order to improve performance for our target species. <br> <br>
