title: "Active Learning-Based Species Range Estimation"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/active
excerpt: "We introduce a new active learning based approach for the prediction of a species' range from limited data and evaluate our approach on two ground truth datasets. Our approach essentially combines species distribution models for well known species in order to create improved range maps for our target species, and suggests new locations to search for the target species to most improve our current range map. <br> <br>
