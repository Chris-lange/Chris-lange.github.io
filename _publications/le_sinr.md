title: "Combining Observational Data and Language for Species Range Estimation"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/le_sinr
excerpt: "We propose a novel approach combining millions of citizen science species observations with textual descriptions from Wikipedia, covering habitat preferences and range descriptions for tens of thousands of species. Our framework maps locations, species, and text descriptions into a common space, facilitating the learning of rich spatial covariates at a global scale and enabling zero-shot range estimation from textual descriptions. <br> <br>
