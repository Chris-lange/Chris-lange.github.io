I have just submitted my PhD thesis in Machine Learning at [School of Informatics Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics), where I was supervised by [Michael Gutmann](https://michaelgutmann.github.io/).

I am interested in leveraging deep neural networks to perform various types of unsupervised probabilistic inference. My publications focused on learning and sampling deep energy-based models, but have broader applicability to areas such as mutual information estimation and Bayesian inference.
