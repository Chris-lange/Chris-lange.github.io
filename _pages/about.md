I am a PhD student in Machine Learning at [the School of Informatics Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics), where I am supervised by [Oisin Mac Aodha](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/omacaod/).

I am interested in applying machine learning to science, representation learning, and methods to exploit available large datasets to improve performance in related tasks. My publications focus on generating spatial representations from noisy community collected data and developing new approaches to species distribution modelling by utilizing disjoint species information.
