I am a Machine Learning PhD student at the [School of Informatics Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics), supervised by [Michael Gutmann](https://michaelgutmann.github.io/).

I am interested in leveraging deep neural networks to perform various types of unsupervised probabilistic inference. Specific research interests include: contrastive representation learning, density-estimation and energy-based modelling.
